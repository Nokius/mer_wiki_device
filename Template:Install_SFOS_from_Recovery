{{note|note=Some devices do not have removable SD cards. Regardless, there should still be a partition on the device named "<code>/sdcard</code>" that can be used for flashing purposes, even though the contents of <code>/sdcard</code> may actually be in internal storage.}}
# Your {{{device_name}}} should still be connected to your PC via USB from the last step
# Your {{{device_name}}} should still be booted to ClockworkMod from the last step
# If neither statement is currently true, please reboot to ClockworkMod. If you do not have CWM loaded, follow the steps outlined above.
