You can use fastboot to install your recovery image to the device.

'''Installing ClockworkMod Recovery on the {{{device_name}}}'''
# Your {{{device_name}}} should still be connected to your PC via USB from the last step
# Power off the {{{device_name}}} and activate the bootloader {{{device_recovery_boot_steps}}} 
# Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC sees the device by typing <code>fastboot devices</code>
#*If you don't see your device serial number, and instead see "<waiting for device>", fastboot is not configured properly on your machine. See  [[Doc:_fastboot_intro|fastboot]] documentation for more info.
# On your PC, download the [http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager latest ClockworkMod] recovery image (at time of writing, 6.0.4.5)
# Flash CWM to your {{{device_name}}}, making sure to use the proper filename for the image you downloaded:
<code>
  $ fastboot flash recovery recovery-clockwork-6.0.4.5-{{#lowercase:{{{device_codename}}}}}.img
  sending 'recovery' (6526 KB)...

<ol start="7">
<li> Reboot to bootloader, by powering off, then {{{device_recovery_boot_steps}}} 
<li> Use the Volume Up or Volume Down key to select "Recovery mode", and the Power button to enter recovery.</li>
<li> At this point, ClockworkMod should load.</li>
</ol>
<!--
{{#if:{{{install_file|}}}|
#Download {{{install_devname}}}'s ClockworkMod Recovery.
#*{{{install_devname}}}'s ClockworkMod Recovery: [{{{install_file}}} download] 
#*:md5: <code>{{{install_md5sum}}}</code>
}}
# Connect the {{{device_name}}} to the computer via USB.
# Make sure the fastboot binary is in your [[Template:Paths|PATH]] or that you place the downloaded image in the same directory as fastboot.
#Open a terminal on your PC and reboot the device into fastboot mode by typing <code>adb reboot bootloader</code> or by using the hardware key combination.
#Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC sees the device by typing <code>fastboot devices</code>
#*If you don't see your device serial number, and instead see "<waiting for device>", fastboot is not configured properly on your machine. See  [[Doc:_fastboot_intro|fastboot]] documentation for more info.
#Flash ClockworkMod Recovery onto your device by entering the following command: <code>fastboot flash recovery your_recovery_image.img</code> where the latter part is the name of the file you downloaded.
#Once the flash completes successfully, reboot the device into recovery to verify the installation. This can be done by typing <code>fastboot boot your_recovery_image.img</code>.
#*Note: Some ROMs overwrite recovery at boot time so if you do not plan to immediately boot into recovery to install SailfishOS Ports , please be aware that this may overwrite your custom recovery with the stock one.-->
